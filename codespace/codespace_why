codespace
Instead of using the local computer.
A place to set up the infrastructure (gcp + terraform)
+ Same for everyone, reproduction should be easier.
+ Accessible
+ Durability ie local computer breaks down
- Environment start from scratch (could also be a good thing, no dependencies)

.env.example
To create an .env for the project setup. 
+ A centralized place to specifiy all the information needed for the project. 
+ Automation using scripts
+ "Default" information already filled out.
- Security?

init_codespace.sh
A shell script to automate setup
+ All commands from GCP SDK installation to terraform apply gathered in one place.
+ No copy-paste or detailed instructions needed 
- Less freedom to do thing differently/better/my way. Workaround: run the commands in the terminal in the order you want.
- Bugs?
